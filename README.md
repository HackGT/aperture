Acts as an all-in-one experience for the [HackGT sponsorship portal](https://github.com/HackGT/sportal). The web app is included in an Edge WebView for good performance and experience on touch screens and tablets.

The highlight of this integration is NFC badge integration. By using this distribution version of the sponsorship portal, sponsors can scan HackGT NFC badges and have three options:

* User's resume and other information automatically pulled up on screen + user added to an attended list to keep track of post-event
* Copy badge UUID to clipboard (for integration with other HackGT tools)
* Output badge UUID to a line-by-line scan log with timestamps of visits
